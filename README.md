The notebooks are pretty self explanatory, Milan_Roads_complete contains a description of the dataset and how one may want to use it, along with everything else that i've done so far.
You can contact me for any questions.
Obviously, inside the notebooks there are file locations which are valid on my local machine and must be edited into where you have saved your files.
Milan_Roads_Network_Trials is a subset of Milan_Roads_complete. It focuses on the creation of the graph network of the roads.
I will do my best to update these notebooks everytime i work on them locally.
