The notebooks are pretty self explanatory, and they Milan Roads 2020 contains a description of the dataset and how one may want to use it.
You can contact me for any questions.
Obviously, inside the notebooks there are file locations which are valid on my local machine and must be edited into where you have saved your files.
Milan subdivisions merges the main datasrt with two others containing neighborhood information, to make it easier to subdivide and plot data. It also contains a function to view all streets within a certain distance from a given street.
I will do my best to update these notebooks everytime i work on them locally.
