The notebooks are pretty self explanatory, Milan_Roads_complete contains a description of the dataset and how one may want to use it, along with everything else that i've done so far.
You can contact me for any questions.
Obviously, inside the notebooks there are file locations which are valid on my local machine and must be edited into where you have saved your files.
I will do my best to update these notebooks everytime i work on them locally.
